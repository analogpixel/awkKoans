== Matching and Not Matching
Within the regular expression language, the dot, . , operator matches
any one character, so a.c would match abc, acc, adc ...etc.  The syntax [^...]
is used to negate a match, so a[^bc]c would match aac adc but not abc or acc.

In this koan, match the lines where the first letter is a, the second letter
is anything except b or c and there is one more letter before the end of the line

== Hints
* the end of line match is $
* . matches anything
* [^...] syntax exludes items from being matched
