== Introduction to AWK
The basic function of awk is to search files for lines that
contain certain patterns.  When a line matches one of the,
patterns, awk performs specified actions on that line.  awk
keeps processing input lines in this way until it reaches
the end of the input files --Effective awk programming


== Hints
* An awk rule consists of a pattern folled by an action
* the action is enclosed in curly braces
* an awk program would like like:  pattern {action}
* to print the entire line in awk: print $0
