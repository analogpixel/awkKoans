== Match at Least once
In the regex langauge, the plus sign is used to match ONE OR MORE
of whatever appears before the +. Like the * match, this is greedy and
will match as much as it can.  If you have the string
aaaabc, a+b would match aaaab.

ca+b would match cab caab but not cb

In this koan, match: c and then 1 or more a(s) and then a b

== Hints
* + matches one more more of whatever comes before it
