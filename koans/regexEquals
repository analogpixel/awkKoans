== TITLE
Regular Expressions are large part of AWK, so there is a special
character to match if a variable matches a regular expression. The
~ and !~ operators are used to do matching, for example "apple" ~ /a/
will return true.

Using this knowledge add up all the second columns that have a
capital J in the first column.

== Hints
* regular expressions are surrounded by //
* use ~ to match a column against a regular expresion
