== Fields and Records
Data comes in all shapes and sizes, and due to that Awk allows
you to set the characters that define where a record ends, and where a
field ends.  RS is the variable that holds the pattern that indicates
where a record ends, and FS is the variable that holds where the field
ends.  So RS = "" and FS = "\n" would indicate that a record ends on a blank
line and the fields ends at the end of a line

In this koan, print out just the name on the address records

== Hints
* RS is the variable that sets the record separator
* FS is the variable that sets the field separator
