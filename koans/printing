== Printing
Print is the command that gets data from the computer to you.  Using
the command by itself, print, is the same as typing print $0, which is
the same as printing out the current row.  Using a comma between variables
allows us to separate multiple values ($1,$2 for example).  OFS and ORS are
variables that allow us to change how things are separated, and how the
record ends (space and newline by default).

Use this to parse the input file and output the first two columns with a ;
and place all record on the same line separated by ]

== Hints
* The OFS variable sets the field separator
* the ORS variable sets the record separator
* setting those variables should happen in the BEGIN section
