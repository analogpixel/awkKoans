== Match once or not at all
In the regex langauge, the asterisk is used to match ZERO OR MORE
of whatever appears before the *. This is a more greedy match than the
question mark which also matches zero or more occurrences.  If you have the string
aaaabc, a?b would match ab, but if you used a*b it would match aaaab.

ca?b would match cab caab and cb

In this koan, match: c and then 0 or more a(s) and then a b

== Hints
* ? matches 0 or more occurrences of whatever comes before it.
