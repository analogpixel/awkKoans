# AWK Koans
Awk koans is a framework for learning AWK through doing small lab based exercises.


## Installation
Basic instructions are just download the zip distribution, unzip it
somewhere and then run python koans.py

### Windows
This requires some sort of terminal that can display ansi colors. I've gotten
it working with ConEmu:https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/

After that you'll need python:http://www.python.org installed and added to your path.

Then just open ConEmu, cd into the directory you unziped the kaons into and
run python koans.py

### Linux
nothing special needs to be done.

## Using the Koans
After running python koans.py you will be presented with a koan. When the koan is displayed, it'll also create the file you need to edit within the directory.
